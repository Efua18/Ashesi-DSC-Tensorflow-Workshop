# Ashesi-DSC-Tensorflow-Workshop
Python notebooks from my talk at Ashesi University's Developer Student Club Tensorflow workshop

The first notebook demonstrates linear regression, by teaching a learning algorithm to predict fahrenheit values from celcius values 
after mimicking the conversion formula based on just two small arrays we use as our dataset.

The second notebook demonstrates classification of various items of clothing using the the much larger Fashion_MNIST dataset.
